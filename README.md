# Pig Dice Game
My own spin on the javascript app made in the following [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview). The player is able to toggle between the single and double dice variations of the game, and has the choice of four themes to use. They are also able to modify the points needed for a win. 

## Rules

Two players take turns rolling for points, which are added to a temporary score. If the player chooses to hold, the temporary score is added to their global score. You can roll as many times as you like in a single turn, but be careful - you can quickly lose it all! The player who first reaches a global score of atleast 100 points wins.

### One Dice Variation

* If you roll a 1, you lose your temporary score and your turn immediately ends.

### Two Dice Variation

* If you roll a 1, you lose your temporary score and your turn immediately ends.
* If you roll two 1s, you lose both your temporary and global score, and your turn immediately ends.
